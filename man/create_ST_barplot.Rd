\title{Create a Stacked Barplot of ST Distribution}
\usage{
create_ST_barplot(file_path, output_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A character string specifying the path to the CSV file to be read.
This parameter is not currently used within the function body as written,
which operates on a globally assigned 'masterdata' object. For a reusable
package, it's recommended to modify the function to accept 'masterdata' as an
argument directly.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string specifying the directory where the plot will be saved.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value. It prints a ggplot object to a PNG file
and provides a message confirming the save location.
}
\description{
This function generates a stacked barplot showing the distribution of the
top 20 most frequent Sequence Types (STs) and their association with the
presence or absence of carbapenemase genes. The plot is saved as a PNG file.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'masterdata' is a data frame loaded in the environment
# ST_barplot(file_path = "data.csv", output_dir = "plots")
}
