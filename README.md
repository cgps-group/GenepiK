# Genomics_epidemiology
An R package to perform genomics epidemiology. 

It includes functions to perform the following:

**Phenotypic AST data**

Produce a barplot with the proportion of R/I/S per drug class split by CARBA-R/CARBA-S.

**Species distribution & MLST**

Produce a barplot with the 20 most common sequence types and their proportion of CARBA-R/CARBA-S.

**AMR determinants /virulence**

For both CARB-R and S, do two upset plots i) resistance profile by class, and ii) carbapenamase genes.

For both CARB-R and S, do two upset plots with virulence scores and genes.
